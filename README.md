   It's a tool to convert Latitude, Longitude, D.Lat, D.Long, Variation, Deviation, True Course, Compass Course, Magnetic Course, Compass Error, True Bearing, Compass Bearing
   
# Automation-
## 2. Ship Lines Plan Drawing
   Automated system to draw a ship lines plan from offset plan and download the generated file in dwg format.
## 3. Ship Hydrostatic Calculation
   Calculate ship hydrostatic parameters automatically and visualize the parameters in graph. You can also download the calculation process, graph in csv and pdf format.
## 4. Ship Trim Calculation
